<heading>INTRODUCTION</heading><heading>International Humanitarian Law</heading>International humanitarian law ("IHL"), also known as jus in bello, refers to the branch of international law that regulates the conduct of hostilities and the protection of persons not, or no longer, involved in hostilities. The fundamental objective of IHL is to minimise the adverse effects of conflict whenever it occurs. <fnote>International Committee of the Red Cross/Red Crescent, What is international humanitarian law? (2004) < URL > at 2 January 2007. </fnote>The rules of IHL find expression primarily through the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 ("GCs") and their two Additional Protocols of 1977 ("APs"), as well as relevant jurisprudence and international customary law. <fnote>Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, opened for signature 12 August 1949, (entered into force 21 October 1950); Convention (II) for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, opened for signature 12 August 1949, (entered into force 21 October 1950); Convention (III) relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, opened for signature 12 August 1949, (entered into force 21 October 1950); Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, opened for signature 12 August 1949, (entered into force 21 October 1950). </fnote><fnote>Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol 1), opened for signature 8 June 1977, (entered into force 7 December 1979); Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), opened for signature 8 June 1977, (entered into force 7 December 1978). </fnote>Since the predominant codification of IHL following the Second World War, the landscape of armed conflict has altered significantly in response to technological, political and societal change. Among other things, reports indicate an increasing use of children as combatants throughout the world, particularly in relation to non-international conflicts, which now constitute nearly all conflict in the world today, as opposed to between one third to one half of all conflict in the mid-20 th century. <fnote>For a discussion of the consequences of advanced weapon technology and an increase in transnational conflict involving non-state actors, see: Program on Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research, Transnationality, War and the Law (2006) Harvard University < URL > at 5 January 2007. </fnote><fnote>Mann, Howard, 'International Law and the Child Soldier' (1987) 36 International and Comparative Law Quarterley 32, 35. </fnote><fnote>Program on Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research, above no 4, 7. </fnote><heading>Purpose of Report</heading>The purpose of this report is to consider the rules of IHL that are of particular relevance to child soldiers in order to ascertain whether such rules are sufficiently adequate to address the participation and use of child soldiers in armed conflict. The underlying enquiry is whether IHL, as presently framed, effectively meets its objectives of protection and harm minimisation in relation to child soldiers, in light of the particular characteristics of both child soldiers inherently and the circumstances of their involvement. Firstly, the nature of the subject area, namely child soldiers, will be outlined. Secondly, the key provisions of IHL pertaining to child soldiers will be reviewed. Thirdly, certain significant deficiencies in IHL in relation to child soldiers will be highlighted, with a focus on the regulation of the use of child soldiers in non-international armed conflict. Finally, recommendations as to the avenues for addressing the deficiencies will be presented as a basis for further discussion and action, including a consideration of the relevant interrelationship between IHL and other branches of international law <heading>CHILD SOLDIERS IN ARMED CONFLICT</heading>As the term "child soldier" is not defined explicitly in the GCs or the APs, it is useful to consider the widely adopted interpretation promulgated by the Cape Town Principles, which gives the following broad definition: <quote>"...any person under 18 years of age who is part of any kind of regular or irregular armed force or armed group in any capacity, including but not limited to cooks, porters, messengers, and anyone accompanying such groups, other than family members. The definition includes girls recruited for sexual purposes and for forced marriage. It does not, therefore, only refer to a child who is carrying or has carried arms."</quote><fnote>UNICEF & NGO Working Group on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Cape Town Principles and Best Practices (1997) < URL > at 4 January 2007. </fnote>Estimates suggest that approximately 300,000 children are serving as soldiers in current armed conflicts around the world. This participation is widespread, with documented use of child soldiers in over 30 ongoing or recent armed conflicts in almost every region of the world, particularly Africa and Asia.  <fnote>United Nations, Children and Armed Conflict: Report of the Secretary-General UN Doc A/55/163 (2000). </fnote><fnote>Human Rights Watch, Stop the Use of Child Soldiers! < URL > at 31 December 2006. For a list of countries in which children are currently participating as soldiers in armed conflicts, whether in government forces, paramilitaries, or opposition forces, see < URL > at 31 December 2006. </fnote>The roles undertaken by child soldiers may include, among others, participation in actual combat, involvement in the abduction and training of other children, sexual and domestic slaves, "porters, cooks, spies and [planters] of land mines". It is not uncommon for children to participate in an indirect manner initially and then progress to a more direct, active role in the hostilities, often necessitating the use of extreme violence against others. Various commentators have identified reasons for the attractiveness of child soldiers to, in particular, dissident armed groups in non-international armed conflict, many of which centre on the ability of child soldiers to be easily manipulated, exploited and controlled by army commanders.  <fnote>Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF), Child Soldiers (2006) 1 < URL > at 29 December 2006. </fnote><fnote>Florence Holst-Roness, Violence against Girls in Africa During Armed Conflicts and Crises (2006) International Committee of the Red Cross 13 < URL > at 29 December 2006. </fnote><fnote>Ibid. </fnote><fnote>Radio National, 'The Child Soldier and International Law', Perspective, 2 February 2005 9 < URL > at 29 December 2006. </fnote><fnote>Nsongurua J Udombana, 'War is not Child's Play!

In many countries, child soldiers are forcibly recruited through abduction or physical coercion. Further, it is often the case that the apparent distinction between voluntary and involuntary recruitment is blurred, with many commentators arguing that any "free choice" in this regard is strictly curtailed in reality, particularly in highly charged conflict situations where children are often displaced and look to armed forces or groups for structure and protection. Research into the underlying reasons for the involvement of children in war, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, has revealed the significance of extant adverse economic, social and cultural circumstances at a national and local level.  <fnote>UNICEF and United Nations, Report of Graça Machel, Expert of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, UN Doc A/51/306/Add.1 (1996) 11 < URL > at 5 January 2007. </fnote><fnote>See Rachel Brett, Adolescents volunteering for armed forces or armed groups (2003) International Committee of the Red Cross 863 < URL > at 29 December 2006 for an analysis of the five major factors identified as prompting decisions by children to voluntarily join armed forces or armed groups, namely war, poverty, education, employment, family. </fnote><fnote>For a discussion of the extensive security, economic, cultural and social reasons underlying the widespread participation of children in war, see generally: UNICEF and United Nations, above no 16. </fnote>In addition to their contribution to the armed conflict and commission of atrocities, it is generally recognised that children themselves suffer grave human rights violations including "physical, mental, and sexual abuses ranging from their abduction and forced recruitment, to drug abuse and rape" during and following their recruitment.  <fnote>Sarah Wells, 'Crimes Against Child Soldiers in Armed Conflict Situations: Application and Limits of International Humanitarian Law' (2004) 12 Tulane Journal of International and Comparative Law 287, 289. </fnote><heading>IHL AND CHILD SOLDIERS</heading><heading>Special Protection of Children Generally</heading>In relation to armed conflict, IHL has traditionally sought to offer children protection as both civilians and as one of the groups regarded as being particularly vulnerable to the effects of war, on the assumption that children are non-combatants. In this regard, numerous provisions in the GCs and the APs relate directly or indirectly (for example, in connection with the family unit, expectant mothers, education and similar issues) to the special position and protection of children. <fnote>Mann, above no 5, 35. Mann notes that, although the first widespread use of children as combatants occurred in the Second World War, such use was viewed then as an aberration from their traditional non-combatant status. </fnote><fnote>Geneva Convention III, above no 2, articles 16, 49; Geneva Convention IV, above no 2, articles 14, 16-18, 21-27, 38, 49-51, 68, 76, 81, 82, 85, 89, 91, 94, 119, 127, 132, 136-140; Additional Protocol I, above no 3, articles 8, 52, 70, 74-78; Additional Protocol II, above no 3, articles 4-6. </fnote><heading>Rules Specifically Relating to Child Soldiers</heading>The GCs or APs do not explicitly state that children can never become combatants. Instead, certain provisions place limits on the authorities in control of recruitment, as follows: <heading>(1) Additional Protocol Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, 1977 ("AP I")</heading>In relation to child soldiers, articles 77(2) and (3) of AP I state that: <quote>"The Parties to the conflict shall take all feasible measures in order that children who have not attained the age of fifteen years do not take a direct part in hostilities and, in particular, they shall refrain from recruiting them into their armed forces. In recruiting among those persons who have attained the age of fifteen years but who have not attained the age of eighteen years, the Parties to the conflict shall endeavour to give priority to those who are oldest." </quote><fnote>Additional Protocol I, above no 3, article 77(2). </fnote><quote>"If, in exceptional cases, despite the provisions of paragraph 2, children who have not attained the age of fifteen years take a direct part in hostilities and fall into the power of an adverse Party, they shall continue to benefit from the special protection accorded by this Article, whether or not they are prisoners of war." </quote><fnote>Ibid article 77(3). </fnote>AP I expanded the concept of traditional international armed conflict, to include "armed conflicts in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination and alien occupation and against racist regimes in the exercise of their right of self-determination." The scope of these clauses is, however, very limited as AP I does not apply to many modern armed conflicts at the present time.  <fnote>Ibid article 4. </fnote><fnote>Ilene Cohn and Guy S. Goodwin-Gill, Child Soldiers: The Role of Children in Armed Conflict. A Study for the Henry Dunant Institute, Geneva (1994), 57. Cohn and Goodwin-Gill note that the drafting of Additional Protocol I took place with a political content and purpose, being aimed specifically at racist and colonial regimes and alien occupation. </fnote><heading>(2) Additional Protocol Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-international Armed Conflict, 1977 </heading>In relation to child soldiers, article 4(3)(c) of AP II states that: <quote>"children who have not attained the age of fifteen years shall neither be recruited in the armed forces or groups nor allowed to take part in hostilities."</quote><fnote>Additional Protocol II, above no 3, article 4(3)(c). Accordingly, as this APII provision prohibits the participation of children, whether direct or indirect, in non-international armed conflict, the prohibition on the use of children in armed conflict is broader than in API. </fnote>Further, article 4(3)(d) confirms that the special protections to be afforded to children in non-international armed conflict under AP II remain applicable to children under the age of 15 even if they take direct part in hostilities despite article 4(3)(c) and are captured.  <fnote>Ibid article 4(3)(d). </fnote>Additional Protocol II applies to non-international armed conflict taking place within a state "...between its armed forces and dissident armed forces or other organised armed groups which, under responsible command, exercise such control over a part of its territory as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations and to implement this Protocol." <fnote>Ibid article 1. </fnote>It is explicitly stated that "situations of internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence and other acts of a similar nature, as not being armed conflicts" are outside the scope of AP II. <fnote>Ibid article 2. </fnote><heading>Other Branches of International of Law</heading>IHL as it relates to child soldiers cannot properly be understood without an understanding of the broader international legal framework offering protection to children, including elements of the international human rights, international criminal law and international labour law systems. <heading>IHL AND CHILD SOLDIERS </heading><heading>Identification of Areas of Deficiency</heading>In light of the key IHL provisions applicable to child soldiers and the characteristics of the participation of child soldiers in modern armed conflict, several areas of concern arise regarding the ability of IHL to fulfil its essential objectives where child soldiers are concerned. These include uncertainties or gaps concerning, among other things, the legal rules concerning the prohibition on, regulation of and prosecution of child soldiers, as well as the prosecution of persons recruiting children as combatants contrary to the relevant provisions. These include (but are not limited to): (1) The extent to which there exists a ban on the participation of children as combatants and the consensus among the international community as to the minimum age of permitted participation; (2) The degree of participation of children, namely direct or indirect, allowed by IHL in the varying categories of conflict; (3) The extent to which the relevant AP provisions permit voluntary recruitment of child soldiers;  <fnote>See generally, Cohn and Goodwin-Gill, above no 25, 61. A review of the original negotiation in relation to the drafting of the APs reveals a desire by governments not to enter into absolute prohibitions regarding the voluntary participation of children in armed conflict. </fnote>(4) The protection and status of child soldiers involved in conflict deemed to be below a certain (inexact) threshold; and (5) The minimal protection and regulation of child soldiers during actual conflict. <heading>Focus of Report</heading>The issues surrounding child soldiers are complex and it is beyond the scope of this report to consider each of the above issues comprehensively. Instead, this report focuses primarily on the fifth issue, namely the protection and regulation of children once they actually become child soldiers (despite any prohibition on their recruitment). This issue is considered in relation to non-international conflict only given that this type of conflict is of most relevance to child soldiers in the current climate of world hostilities. <heading>Protection and Regulation of Participating Child Soldiers</heading><heading>Narrow Focus of IHL in Relation to Child Soldiers </heading>The AP articles detailed above are of inherently limited application to modern conflict as the primary aim of IHL appears to be to prevent the use of child soldiers completely in non-international conflict rather than the express regulation, in terms of treatment or status, once such participation occurs in reality. Advances in relation to this aspiration have been made; among other things, the negotiation of the Optional Protocol to the CRC on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict ("Optional Protocol") has been a significant milestone in the reflection of, and contribution to, a growing consensus by the international community for adoption of 18 as the minimum age for recruitment.  <fnote>Wells, above no 19, 296. </fnote><fnote>Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, opened for signature 25 May 2000, (entered into force 12 February 2002). </fnote><fnote>For a discussion of this issue, see Udombana, above no 14, 91-101. </fnote>However, whilst the current gap between the idealism of a complete exclusion of children and the realities of an ever increasing use of child soldiers persists, it is unrealistic not to consider the application of IHL to child soldiers, where they become involved in practice despite the prohibitions (whether in IHL or through the Optional Protocol) on the involvement of children in hostilities. In this regard, the restricted approach of IHL offer little express assistance to child soldiers or acknowledgement of their particular position. <heading>Effect of Combatant Status on Child Soldiers </heading>Once children participate actively or directly in non-international armed conflict, their status under the present IHL framework is recognised as that of combatants and consequently they lose the more substantive humanitarian protections afforded to civilians under the framework of IHL. This is the case whether such involvement is voluntary or forced. <fnote>Wells, above no 19, 297. </fnote>Whilst child soldiers maintain the special protections afforded to children under IHL, these are arguably inadequate to recognise their involvement in combat. AP II does not establish minimum humanitarian standards of treatment that ought to apply to children who do participate in conflicts. Further, from the perspective of child soldiers, the protections guaranteed to civilians may appear more important than the special protections afforded to children as the former more expressly provide for their humane treatment at all times. <fnote>Additional Protocol II, above no 3, article 4(3)(d). </fnote><fnote>Wells, above no 19, 297. </fnote><fnote>Ibid 296 </fnote>In any event, the special protections may be merely theoretical as the wording of article 4 of AP II suggested that these are to be provided by opposing forces, not the forces for which the child soldiers are aligned. In this regard, the fundamental guarantees "shall remain applicable to them if they take a direct part in hostilities...and are captured" (emphasis added) and measures are required to be taken "to remove children temporarily from the area in which hostilities are taking place to a safer area within the country", action that surely contradicts the intentions of the armed groups towards their own child soldiers. Even if this is not the intention, it is unlikely that the general protections afforded to children will realistically be guaranteed in circumstances where children have been forcibly recruited into armed forces by commanders with little concern for their welfare, or indeed the legality of their participation generally. <fnote>Additional Protocol II, above no 3, article 4(3)(d). </fnote><fnote>Ibid article 4(3)(e). </fnote><fnote>See Harvey, above no 15,26, who notes that "those who choose to recruit children can often do so with impunity" due to the low risk of being caught and the difficulties in monitoring recruitment practices during a conflict as a result of the transitory nature of childhood, inadequate birth registration documents and the effects of malnutrition, all of which cause difficulties in determining age. </fnote>As combatants, child soldiers are subject to the same rules as adult combatants. While adult combatants clearly suffer adverse effects from war, the situation of child soldiers is marked by the characteristics outlined earlier in this report, such as violently forced recruitment (or voluntary recruitment in circumstances that offer little alternative), control through drugs and sexual slavery. Further, children arguably have a reduced ability to remove themselves from a negative army environment and a less developed (when compared to adult combatants) capacity to fend for themselves if they leave dissident army forces, due to the same factors that prompted their involvement in the first place, such as poverty, hunger, displacement from family and home, and a lack of regular structure due to war (for example, closed schools or destroyed infrastructure). The status of combatants (without appropriate recognition of the blurred reality between status as combatants and a group among the most vulnerable in wartime) will also have implications for child soldiers post-conflict, both in terms of their own potential prosecution and the prosecution of persons committing offences against them during and after recruitment. <fnote>See generally, Wells, above no 19. </fnote><heading>Failure to Obtain Even the 'Special Protection' Under IHL</heading>In certain circumstances, child soldiers may not even be guaranteed the special protections guaranteed to children under IHL, primarily for the following reasons: <heading>(1) Difficulties in Invoking AP II</heading>Even where the relevant conflict can be categorised objectively as that in relation to which AP II would ordinarily apply, it may be the case that the requirements of its article 1 are not technically met, the relevant state has not ratified AP II, and/or the dissident armed force or other organised armed group has not made a unilateral declaration confirming its acceptance of AP II. <fnote>Additional Protocol II, above no 3, article 1. That is, where the non-state party to the conflict does not "exercise such control over a part of its territory as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations and to implement [AP II]. </fnote><fnote>See Cohn and Goodwin-Gill, above no 25, 66-67, for examples of non-international conflict where states have not ratified AP II, and examples of non-international conflict where states and non-state parties have been prepared to be bound by AP II. </fnote><heading>(2) Conflict Categorisation</heading>Child soldiers are often involved in conflict which does not appear to reach the threshold required by AP II and therefore will not be subject to the special protection provisions of IHL.  <fnote>Ibid 60. </fnote>In such cases, domestic law and pertinent human rights provisions (that have not been subject to derogation) remain applicable even in the absence of the special protections offered to children generally under IHL. Further, the minimal conditions of Common Article 3 to the GCs will continue to govern this type of internal conflict, although they place no limits on the recruitment or participation of children. <heading>Conclusion and Recommendations</heading><heading>Conclusion</heading>This report has sought to demonstrate that the current framework of IHL is not effective in relation to the protection and regulation of child soldiers in their status as combatants. The nature of the underlying causes for child soldier participation, their treatment during and following recruitment, and the roles that they perform demonstrate that children are both combatants and victims of serious human rights violations in armed conflicts.  <fnote>Wells, above no 19, 302 </fnote>A number of preliminary recommendations are set out below, for the purpose of provoking further discussion and a consideration of potential revision to IHL to facilitate its enhanced applicability to modern conflict. <heading>Recommendations</heading><heading>(1) Consideration of Underlying Conditions</heading>Further research and discussions ought to be conducted in order to reach a better understanding of and to address the underlying causes of the participation and use of children as child soldiers. <fnote>Udombana, above no 14, 106. </fnote>IHL applies only during conflict. For child soldiers to be protected adequately from participation, during and post conflict, in their capacity as children, it is important to take a more holistic approach and "acknowledge and address the entire context of conflict - the social, cultural, geopolitical, economic, geographical, development and equity considerations - in which children become weapons of war". <fnote>Radio National, above no 13. </fnote><heading>(2) Complementary Branches of International Law</heading>Further consideration of and strengthening of the relationship between IHL and international human rights, international criminal law and international labour law ought to be pursued for the purpose of establishing and maintaining a minimal standard of humanitarian treatment (covering, among other things, access to food, water and medicine and adequate conditions of hygiene, safety, shelter) in relation to child soldiers in non-international conflict and in situations short of the relevant threshold, where IHL fails to fulfil its protective objective.  <fnote>Allan Rosas and Monika Sandvik-Nylund, 'Armed Conflicts' in Asbjørn Eide, Catarina Krause and Allan Rosas (eds), Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (2nd ed, 2001) 415. </fnote>Of particular relevance is article 38 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child ("CRC"), which represents an incorporation of IHL into international human rights law, thereby reinforcing the obligations already assumed by states under IHL relating to the child. This allows for the monitoring and increased scope for enforcement of obligations by the CRC Committee, and is particularly relevant in circumstances where states have not ratified the GCs and/or the APs but have ratified the CRC. <fnote>Convention on the Rights of the Child, opened for signature 20 November 1989, (entered into force 2 September 1990). </fnote><fnote>Udombana, above no 14, 81. </fnote>Generally, a human rights approach ought to be adopted to draw attention to the ways in which children's rights are being violated as child soldiers, in the wider context of the effect of non-international armed conflict on their lives. Whilst the international human rights system focuses on the obligations of states, effective pressure can also be placed on non-state parties to conflicts directly, given the authoritative and legitimate power of the human rights discourse, and indirectly, through pressure placed on states to monitor the actions of the non-state parties. Relevant contributions from the international labour law system and international criminal law will assist in this objective. <fnote>The CRC is important in the context of armed conflicts as it does not permit derogations under any circumstances. </fnote>A consistent and informed international approach to the unique difficulties faced by child soldiers would be beneficial in ensuring that set standards of protection of their basic rights (no matter what their source in the totality of international standards) are accepted and promoted widely.
