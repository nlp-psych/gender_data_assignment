<heading>Introduction. </heading>Any form of tourism has both positive and negative impacts on the society in which it operates, but the impacts of indigenous culture based tourism, while undoubtedly far-reaching, are particularly hard to measure. The use of indigenous culture as an asset for tourism is by no means a new phenomenon, but the study of the associated impacts is an area which has only in the last few decades attracted any significant attention. The interdependence of social, cultural, historical, spiritual, political, anthropological, economic and management factors makes indigenous tourism a complex and interesting field, and one worthy of further study. This essay will therefore examine some of the impacts of indigenous culture based tourism in New Zealand, where the Maori have a significant role to play in a highly developed tourism industry. A review of existing literature reveals two main schools of thought, one which accepts and even promotes the use of Maori culture as a tool in tourism marketing: <quote>"The strong culture of the Maori - unique to New Zealand - is a major aspect of our national heritage which enhances New Zealand's appeal to the world's travellers." (New Zealand Tourist Board, 1993: 4, cited by Hall in Butler & Hinch, 1996: 156)</quote>And the other which views such use of the culture as disrespectful and exploitative: <quote>"Pakeha New Zealanders have never been slow to exploit this indigenous culture in promotion and advertising - often in ways that drew Maori disapproval." (Barber, 1992: 19, cited by Hall in Butler & Hinch, 1996: 157)</quote><fnote>Pakeha: A New Zealander of non-Maori, European extraction. (Ryan, 1997) </fnote>The essay will address each point of view with reference to recent studies (Hall, 1996; Ryan, 1997; OTSP & TPK, 2000; Ryan, 2002; McIntosh, 2004), while supporting evidence will be drawn from texts on other indigenous groups involved in tourism. It will also attempt to show that Hinch & Butler's (1996: 5) assessment that 'cultural survival will contribute to economic success and economic success will contribute to cultural survival' is simplistic and that a more thorough, multidisciplinary approach is needed to fully understand the issues and conflicts between indigenous peoples and tourism. <heading>Ethnocentrism. </heading>Ethnocentrism is at the root of many conflicts between indigenous peoples and tourism. It is concerned with the tendency to see the world from a specific perspective, influenced by cultural factors. Quite simply, tourism providers and tourists often have a significantly different world view from that of the "fourth world communities" (Evans, 2004: 315) whose culture they gaze upon. Tourism managers and policy makers are therefore unable to understand the true meaning of indigenous symbols, imagery, practices and beliefs, making sensitive management of that cultural heritage a near impossible task; indigenous communities are often equally restricted in understanding the first world priorities of economic viability and consumerism, leading to disenchantment with tourism. The Maori are more integrated with pakeha society than many indigenous peoples are with their surrounding communities, but ethnocentrism remains an issue. "Maori possess a holistic world view" (Ryan, 1997: 270) in which the people and the land (and everything else) are closely spiritually linked. Additionally, common to many indigenous groups around the world, family and tribal values are hugely significant, decision is traditionally by consensus, and individual entrepreneurship is frowned upon. In contrast, first world values of enterprise and "economic rationalism" (Whitford, Bell & Watkins, 2001) dominate tourism development and must be reconciled as far as possible with the aforementioned traditional values. However, as a New Zealand Government tourism report highlighted: <quote>"There is perceived, among Maori, to be a lack of understanding of Maori values, culture and issues by non-Maori (including tourists and tour operators). [...]. That perceived lack of understanding [...] has also led, arguably, to an overly simplistic dependency on a marketing-led ideology of tourism rather than a concern and understanding of Maori cultural issues." (OTSP & TPK, 2000: 7)</quote>Given that the key decision makers in the politics and management of tourism are predominantly non-indigenous - and above all businessmen, not anthropologists - it is not surprising that the worth of tourism projects is generally judged "by the bottom line of the balance sheet rather than the well-being of people who contribute to the balance sheet" (Whitford, Bell & Watkins, 2001). First world priorities often override the cultural sensibility of indigenous communities, including the Maori. So, while the New Zealand Tourist Board (1993) and Hinch & Butler's introduction (1996) would have us believe in an ideal, mutually beneficial relationship between indigenous culture and tourism, in reality there are deep-rooted interests and principles on both sides which come into direct conflict; the very compatibility of indigenous culture and tourism is called into question. <heading>Overcoming ethnocentrism. </heading>Despite the obvious issues related to cross-cultural understanding and communication, there are strategies which can be employed in order to minimise any problems. The Maori have political representation (Te Puni Kōkiri - Ministry of Maori Development) as well as various groups that have shared responsibility for protecting Maori rights (Ministry of Cultural Affairs; Maori Tourism Task Force, later the Aotearoa Maori Tourist Federation) and concerted efforts have been made to highlight the needs of the Maori so that cultural sensibilities are respected by tourism development. The importance of meaningful dialogue between the industry and indigenous groups should not be understated. Traditionally "there has been minimal consultation with Maori over the promotion of Maori culture in the tourism industry" (OTSP & TPK, 2000: 6) and various reports (Ryan, 1997; OTSP & TPK, 2000, 2001; WTO/UNEP, 2002; Dyer, Aberdeen & Schuler, 2003; Evans, 2004) highlight the lack of culturally appropriate communication with indigenous groups, who may (as in the case of the Maori) favour a process of full partnership and consensus rather than merely being consulted (OTSP & TPK, 2000: 9), or may (as with Australian aborigines) have an oral tradition, rendering letters to elders inappropriate as the predominant means of communication. McClean et al (1997: 9, cited in Dyer, Aberdeen & Schuler, 2003: 85) refers to the 'spirit of partnership' when working with indigenous peoples, a concept which is echoed in much of the existing literature studied on Maori based tourism. This is more than simply involving indigenous peoples in planning and consulting them on the appropriateness of an attraction; a real partnership includes "development that is culturally sustainable, that is, owned, controlled, acceptable and desired by the indigenous communities affected, as well as economically sustainable" (McIntosh, 2004: 1). The community must ideally be involved in all levels of tourism, including, crucially, the interpretation and management of it, for they are the people who best understand sensitive cultural issues and are best placed to manage them. The lack of indigenous involvement in tourism planning, development and management accentuates the problems caused by ethnocentrism and raises related issues regarding Maori custodianship of their own culture and gaining access to the economic benefits of indigenous culture based tourism. Although the need for tourism industry-Maori partnerships is clear, there are obstacles to indigenous involvement. Dyer, Aberdeen & Schuler (2003) identify several key factors, including limited business knowledge, poor education and inability to secure capital loans. Indigenous communities have valuable insights to offer in the interpretation of their culture, but often members of those communities experience a 'glass ceiling' effect whereby they can become involved in low-level activities like guiding (official or otherwise) or arts and crafts, but wield little influence over large tour operators, large attractions or policy makers, and find it hard to access higher levels of management. Evans (2004: 325) notes, "ethnic groups have secured, at least theoretically, international support in their jockeying for cultural recognition and political influence", but case studies (Ryan, 1997; OTSP & TPK, 2000; Whitford, Bell & Watkins, 2001; Dyer, Aberdeen & Schuler, 2003; Evans 2004; McGrath, 2004; McIntosh, 2004) suggest that in reality, many minority ethno-cultural groups lack any real influence and as such are excluded from the custodianship of their own culture. Furthermore, given the overwhelming dominance of 'outsiders' in management positions, indigenous people are also denied access to a significant portion of the economic benefit. Although in New Zealand the segregation of indigenous and non-indigenous people is not as severe as in other countries, Maori face several of the same key issues as other indigenous peoples around the world; If they are not involved in the management and interpretation of their own culture, negative impacts are likely to be greater, and the potential benefits to them, smaller. <heading>The use and abuse of Maori images & symbols. </heading>The potential negative impacts of indigenous culture based tourism are numerous and varied. "Poverty, displacement of communities and the erosion of cultural traditions" (WTO/UNEP, 2002), "rejection of traditional culture itself" (Dyer, Aberdeen & Schuler, 2003), intrusion into sacred sites (OTSP & TPK, 2000), 'dispossession' of culture (Hinch & Butler, 1996: 10) and "clashes of values" (Reisinger, in Seaton, 1994) are just some of the issues faced. However, many of the most serious issues in New Zealand are related to the use and abuse of symbols and images which are sacred to the Maori, but which have become commonplace in tourism marketing, literature and souvenirs. At its extreme, "treating culture as a natural resource or a commodity over which tourists have rights is not simply perverse, it is a violation of the people's cultural rights" (Greenwood, 1978, in Smith, 1989: 179) and is a profoundly negative impact of tourism which arises from an ethnocentric attitude to management; a refusal to consider that perhaps what to us seems a simple design, may, for someone else, have a much deeper spiritual meaning. The ethical dimension of commercially using indigenous images is rarely fully considered. The value of Maori imagery to tourism has long been recognised so has often been exploited. In 1987 the Maori Tourism Task Force highlighted the issue: "It has been of deep concern to the Maori that the Maori image has been used as a marketing tool in the promotion of the tourist industry for over a hundred years [...] It is clear that the Maori image has commercial value. The expressed desire of the Maori people is that they should control their image..." (Maori Tourism Task Force, 1986: 25, cited by Hall in Butler & Hinch, 1996: 170). However, nothing changed and in 1994 the Aotearoa Maori Tourism Federation identified the "misuse of Taonga. This involves the misuse of names and language, mispronunciation, inappropriate use of images on souvenirs and photographs, and the incorrect and inappropriate communication of histories and tribal lore" (cited by Ryan, 1997: 265). <fnote>Taonga: Property, treasure. Used more widely to mean culture as well as tangible items. (Ryan, 1997) </fnote>There is still significant stereotyping, misuse of images and symbols, exploitation, misrepresentation, commoditisation and/or bastardisation of Maori culture. Modern indigenous culture is often neglected in favour of meeting overseas tourist expectations, so a rose-tinted view of a more primitive, bygone age is presented (see for example right - Discover the World, 2004: 24). It is important to recognise that any culture is "dynamic and emergent" (Kroshus Medina, 2003: 354) rather than static, so to present a complex and continually evolving culture simply as a centuries-old tradition may be considered misleading. <picture/>The misrepresentation of indigenous culture and misuse of symbols, due at least in part to pakeha dominance of the industry, highlights the need for indigenous involvement in tourism management as a means of ensuring ethical practices. Furthermore, a lack of legislation leads to problems securing intellectual property rights (OTSP & TPK, 2001: 82-84), meaning that Maori, just like indigenous communities in less developed countries, have to an extent lost control over their heritage. While for the Maori it is an important, respected and valued part of life, in the tourism industry, Maori heritage is largely viewed as an asset; a tool for attracting visitors to New Zealand. The use of indigenous people and culture as a marketing tool is by no means restricted to New Zealand. There are abundant examples in a wide variety of brochures and tourist board promotional materials (Audley Travel, 2005a; Audley Travel , 2005b; Discover The World, 2004; Last Frontiers, 2005; Tourism Australia, 2005; Wanderlust/Journey Latin America, 2005) as well as in company logos (see right - Air New Zealand aircraft livery, in Audley Travel, 2005a: 5). <picture/>Easily identifiable images which tourists immediately relate to a particular country or destination are obviously immensely valuable for tourism promotion. There is little problem when those images are buildings (e.g. Sydney Opera House), monuments (e.g. Eiffel Tower) or other features of the built environment (e.g. Golden Gate Bridge), but when those images are of deep social, cultural or spiritual significance to a community then an assessment must be made regarding their suitability for commoditisation. Maori culture is undeniably valuable to New Zealand tourism and there are notable successes of Maori communities involved in the industry (e.g. The Ngati Wahiao at Whakarewarewa Thermal Village, Rotorua and Ngāi Tahu affiliated to Whale Watch Kaikoura), but they are successful partly because their ethos reflects an understanding of indigenous culture, values and practices which is written into company mission statements (e.g. Ngāi Tahu Holdings Group, 2005). Other, pakeha dominated, companies do not always take such a respectful approach. <heading>Conclusions. </heading>The New Zealand Tourist Board is right to emphasise the importance of Maori heritage for New Zealand tourism and there are undeniably some positive economic and social impacts of tourism for the Maori, e.g. preservation of cultural heritage. This is, however, a superficial view and a more thorough examination reveals deep-rooted problems with the management - or rather, mismanagement - of Maori culture based tourism products. Beyond specifically Maori products, Maori heritage is used inappropriately in the wider New Zealand tourism industry, particularly in marketing. It seems an unequal relationship in which sacred Maori heritage is exploited for commercial ends and the Maori have little or no political or legal recourse, while, as with other indigenous communities around the world, the economic and social benefits are minimal. The industry is dominated by economic rationalism with a near total disregard for anthropological issues, which are left to academics. As Ryan (1997: 257) highlights, "The Ministry of Cultural Affairs [...] notes the need for more attention to environmental, social and cultural effects of tourism and that "greater resources need to be devoted to thinking and a little less to selling" (Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, 1997: 14)" [emphasis added]. The issues associated with indigenous peoples and tourism go far beyond balancing cultural survival and economic success, but non-indigenous tourism professionals are often not in a position to fully understand all the related social, cultural, historical, spiritual and political issues. The sharing of any indigenous culture is a gift, and demands an appropriately sensitive response from tourists and the tourism industry. Without cooperation and knowledge from other disciplines and above all indigenous people themselves, tourism can become highly intrusive and exploitative. Preventing this requires an "acknowledgement of the limitations of Western thinking and assumptions in applying value-judgements" (Evans, 1994b, in Seaton, 1994: 836) and a departure from the ethnocentric, economic rationalist viewpoint discussed by Whitford, Bell & Watkins (2001) which is still so dominant. If this is not possible, then the use of cultural symbols and imagery is perhaps best left to the legitimate custodians of that culture rather than allow it to be appropriated by those who do not fully appreciate its significance.
