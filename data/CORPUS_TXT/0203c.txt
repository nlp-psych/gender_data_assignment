The findings to be looked for on physical examination to help decide the cause.</heading>In summary  presented with a 2 day history of severe abdominal pain and one episode of vomiting.  described the pain as being around his umbilicus and radiating to the right iliac fossa. This indicates that the pain around the umbilicus is referred pain from the midgut (midgut structures being distal duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum, appendix, ascending colon and 2/3 transverse colon).  also described the pain as being colicky in nature. This occurs due to the contraction of smooth muscle against resistance in e.g. ureters, intestine. The pain could therefore be referred from the small intestine. Causes of acute abdominal pain from the small intestine could be due to small bowel obstruction - the four cardinal symptoms of intestinal obstruction are: <list>Colicky abdominal painVomitingAbsolute ConstipationDistension</list>The first three symptoms have been illustrated in the history and so the distension can be looked for on examination, however not all of these 4 features need to be present in a case of intestinal obstruction. Small bowel obstruction is commonly caused by adhesions due to scars from previous surgery. From 's history we know that he has previously had operations on his abdomen and so this may be a potential cause for his presenting complaint.  has also previously had a laparotomy to remove adhesions. Bowel sounds should be auscultated to rule out a paralytic ileus (pseudo obstruction due to reduced bowel motility). However, this most commonly occurs post operatively or can be due to anticholinergic agents - none of which apply to . Bowel sounds are normally found to be tinkling in small bowel obstruction. Other causes of small bowel obstruction include; malignancy (very rare in small intestine and  stated that there had been no weight loss), intersussception (common in children <4 yrs), volvulus and impacted faeces. The pain in the right iliac fossa could be due to a hernia and so the hernial orifices should be palpated on examination. Small bowel obstruction could result from a strangulation of the bowel and this occurs frequently in femoral hernias as the neck of the femoral canal is narrow. It is important to identify a strangulated femoral hernia/strangulated bowel as they are associated with a high mortality rate. Features suggesting strangulation to look for on examination include; rapid pulse, pyrexia, colicky pain becoming continuous as peritonitis develops, tenderness and abdominal rigidity. Midgut pain which radiates to the right iliac fossa is also indicative of appendicitis. There is often guarding over the site of the appendix (McBurneys point) on examination due to the inflammatory process spreading to involve the wall of the peritoneum producing localised intense pain which is continuous and so this should be looked for on examination. However the initial midgut pain is often dull in nature and becomes severe when the peritoneum is involved. Bowel sounds are often absent as the abdomen becomes tender and rigid. Appendicitis is also associated with vomiting which  stated in his history. The patient is normally pyrexic and tachycardic and so these should also be noted on examination. <heading>Physical examination and mental state examination Highlight the findings most relevant to your clinical problem solving by underlining them</heading><heading>General Examination ()</heading>On examination  was lieing in bed and was alert.  had a nasogastric tube and catheter.  did not have a walking aid and there was no sputum pot or urine pot. There was no finger clubbing, palmar erythema, cyanosis of the fingers, leuchonychia or koilonychias. No mouth ulcerations, central cyanosis and no evidence of vitamin deficiencies. No lymphadenopathy. Signs of dehydration were present: dry mucous membranes, normal skin turgor. <list><heading>General Observations</heading>Pulse - 95 bpm irregularly irregular (atrial fibrillation)Blood Pressure - 123/61Respiratory Rate - 20 pmTemperature - 35.8 CSaturations - 98% on air</list><list><heading>CVS:</heading>HS I + II + 0JVP →No ankle oedema</list>RS: Clear vesicular breath sounds CNS GCS 15/15 <heading>Abdominal Examination</heading>Inspection On inspection there was mild distension of the abdomen. Scars from previous operations were noted - gastrectomy and laparotomy. No visible hernias. Palpation The abdomen was tender to palpation especially in the right iliac fossa Auscultation Bowel sounds were present and were high pitched Percussion Percussion of the abdomen was resonant. Comment - Hernial Orifices (from notes) Tender right femoral lump <heading>Analysis of history and examination Reasons for your choice of the cause of the patient's problem(s) and any other cause that still needs to be considered at this stage</heading>On observation and examination the patient was apyrexial and tachycardic. A nasogastric tube was in situ for aspiration of gastric contents as  had been vomiting and there appeared to be signs of dehydration as the mucous membranes were dry. The distension of the abdomen and resonance on percussion indicate that the distension is due to gas and not free fluid. Tenderness in the right iliac fossa and a palpable lump may indicate the presence of a femoral hernia. Given that bowel sounds were present (and the patient presented with pain) an ileus can be ruled out (functional obstruction due to reduced bowel motility). Appendicitis can also be ruled out as 's temperature was stable, bowel sounds were present and there was no guarding over McBurneys point on examination. Bowel sounds were also high pitched indicating obstruction of the bowel. The likely diagnosis at this point could be either an obstructed femoral hernia or obstruction due to adhesions as a result of 's previous surgery and history of adhesions. <heading>Formulation of the patient's problem(s) Encapsulate this in physical, psychological and social terms (the triple diagnosis)</heading> is an 84 year old man who lives alone.  has a significant history of past medical problems, the treatment of which may have contributed to his presenting complaint i.e. previous abdominal surgery.  has obviously been in hospital before, psychologically he stated that he was not particularly concerned about his condition but frustrated at being in hospital again and was keen to get the problem rectified so that he could return home. 's history of medical problems may also hinder his recovery post operatively i.e. recent MI and heavy smoking history. <heading>Management Use the framework of RAPRIOP to structure your proposed management.

Nature of the Disease - Previous surgery has caused some of the loops of bowel which are normally separated to join together. This has caused the bowel to become obstructed. Management Plan -  was advised that if his condition deteriorates he may need a laparotomy to remove the adhesions and consequent bowel obstruction.  would need to be advised that his condition will be monitored to see if the situation can resolve itself without the need for further surgery.

This should include consideration of further issues to be resolved. Where appropriate you should contact by telephone patients who have been discharged home.</heading>Unfortunately,  developed a chest infection approximately four days after the operation. Sputum samples were sent and treatment was advised by the microbiologist - Amoxicillin 500mg TDS for 7 days. The wound from the second operation also became infected and purulent discharge was drained. Swabs of the discharge were taken and were found to be MRSA positive. The consultant microbiologist advised the following treatment for a period of 5 days and to then review: <list>Trimethoprim 200mg BDFusicidic acid 500mg TDS </list>A referral was made to the tissue viability nurse who advised that the wound be treated with VAC therapy. The dietician was also contacted and advised that  be commenced on NG feeding as he had had a prolonged period without adequate nutrition and was at risk of re-feeding syndrome. Later swabs of the infected wound were still MRSA positive - the consultant microbiologist advised that a static dose of vancomycin 1g over 90 mins should be given. It was also advised that the condition of the wound be assessed as it may be colonised with MRSA but not infected elsewhere. Assessment of the wound showed that it was colonised and so treatment was stopped. Referral to  for a rehabilitation bed was organised. <heading>Evidence based care and issues for research A brief consideration of the evidence base required for the diagnosis and management of the patient's problem(s)</heading>Many cases of small bowel obstruction will settle on conservative treatment but in patients with an increasing temperature, raised pulse rate, increasing pain and a raised white cell count, exploratory laparotomy is needed. It is important to try and manage the obstruction conservatively through drip and suck as further surgery could increase the risk of recurrent adhesions and therefore repeat episodes of bowel obstruction. In patients with simple or partial obstruction, resolution occurs in virtually all patients with within 72 hours [1]. If the bowel is gangrenous due to strangulation then a gut resection is needed. It is important to recognise a potential case of strangulated femoral hernia. Evidence has shown that if untreated, strangulated obstructions cause death in 100% of patients. If surgery is performed within 36 hours, the mortality decreases to 8%. The mortality rate is 25% if the surgery is postponed beyond 36 hours in these patients [1]. <heading>Commentary A commentary on issues of health care delivery, ethical issues or disability relevant to the patient and/or problem</heading>Over 80% of cases of small bowel obstruction in adults are due to adhesions [2]. Other common causes are hernias and Crohns Disease. Adhesions can occur after abdominal surgery, and can cause bowel obstruction either in the early or late postoperative period. Early postoperative adhesions are often formed of fibrin (fibrinous adhesions) and can be a transient occurrence. Adhesions that present months or years after surgery are more permanent and are formed of fibrous tissue (fibrous adhesions). Bowel obstruction caused by either fibrinous or fibrous adhesions may settle with conservative management although a laparotomy may be necessary. 's previous surgery and history of small bowel obstruction were risk factors for recurrent adhesive obstruction. Obstruction of the small bowel leads to proximal dilatation of the intestine due to accumulation of GI secretions and swallowed air. This bowel dilatation stimulates cell secretory activity resulting in more fluid accumulation. This leads to increased peristalsis both above and below the obstruction with frequent loose stools and flatus early in its course. Vomiting occurs if the level of obstruction is proximal. Increasing small-bowel distention leads to increased intraluminal pressures. This can cause compression of mucosal lymphatics leading to bowel wall lymphedema. With even higher intraluminal hydrostatic pressures, increased hydrostatic pressure in the capillary beds results in massive third spacing of fluid, electrolytes, and proteins into the intestinal lumen. The fluid loss and dehydration that ensue may be severe and contribute to increased morbidity and mortality [1]. MRSA is a huge problem for hospitals nationwide. Immediate, effective medication is vital in order to treat the infection and prevent further wound dehisence. <heading>Impact on your learning Describe what you have learnt from this case</heading>Physical findings in small bowel obstruction The importance of surgical history in small bowel obstruction The management of small bowel obstruction - Adhesive Obstruction - initially managed conservatively Suck and drip is indicated when the obstruction is one of repeated episodes due to massive intra abdominal adhesions, rendering surgery hazardous and where a short period of observation with conservative treatment is indicated. Conservative treatment is abandoned if there is increased distension, aggravation of pain, increase in abdominal tenderness or rise in pulse. Use of NG tube - Nasogastric tube for gastric aspiration, aims to decompress the bowel and removes the risk of inhalation of gastric contents during induction of anaesthesia. IV fluid replacement - normal saline to replace fluid lost during vomiting Refeeding syndrome - This is a syndrome of hypophosphataemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcaemia and fluid retention which is seen in severely malnourished patients when they are started on enteral or parenteral nuitrition. When the patient is straved, total body loss of these minerals is compensated for by movement of ions out from the cells into plasma, to maintain near normal plasma levels. When feeding is started the increase in insulin level encourages ions to move intracellularly and plasma concentrations fall. Thiamine deficiency may also be a feature. Life-theatening dysrhythmias and congestive cardiac failure can result. Vac therapy - vacuum assisted closure of wounds. The treatment pulls excess fluid and bacteria from the wound site improving blood flow to the wound bed aiding the healing process. Symptoms of small bowel obstruction include: Colicky abdominal pain, felt in mid-abdomen. Need to know site, radiation, duration and relieving factors. no flatus, constipation is present distention, early in the course of the illness if the obstruction is high - seen as vomiting, earlier if the obstruction is relatively proximal in the bowel Signs: dehydration due to loss of fluid from ECF when vomiting. (the gastrointestinal tract secretes 6 litres of fluid per day and during obstruction, this tends to be sequestered) Hypovolaemia may result in hypotension and tachycardia. inspection and palpation may reveal scars, distension, peristalsis, hernias, but no tenderness. If the blood supply is cut off then tenderness develops. auscultation: hyperactive - borborygmus - or ileus rectal examination: may be empty after 24 to 48 hours of symptoms <list><heading>Investigations</heading>blood urea and electrolytes white cell count radiology:  supine: obstructive picture of dilated small bowel  sitting: multiple air/fluid levels in obstruction [3]</list>
